# Tic-Tac-Toe

             ---Tic-Tac-Toe game built to play with the concept of 2D arrays in a simple OOP---

* The game currently features two classes- one containing the main method running an instance of the other.

* In the future, I would like to use the minimax feature in Java to act as the second player.
